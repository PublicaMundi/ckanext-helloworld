## README

This CKAN plugin exists only for demonstration purposes. It basically demonstrates how to:
 * extend core dataset metadata schema with a couple of new fields:
   * a string field "music-genre" taking values from a restricred vocabulary
   * a string field "music-title" as free text
 * theme dataset forms to take into account these new fields.
 * create a helloworld-specific paster command
